# 🚀 intsort: The Most Based Integer Sorting Library You Never Knew You Needed

Are you tired of those boring, run-of-the-mill sorting algorithms that just... sort? Well, buckle up, because `intsort` is here to rock your world and make you question everything you thought you knew about putting numbers in order!

## 🎭 What the hell is this?

`intsort` is a Go library that sorts integers using the power of procrastination and parallelism. It's so ahead of its time, it makes quantum computing look like an abacus.

## 🔥 Features that'll make you go "WTF?"

- **Multi-threaded**: Because why use one core when you can set your entire CPU on fire?
- **Channel-based**: We're basically the Olympic synchronized swimmers of sorting algorithms.
- **Concurrent-safe**: So safe, it makes a Swedish volvo look like a death trap.
- **Sleep-driven architecture**: Finally, a sorting algorithm that values rest as much as you do!

## 🧠 How it works (or doesn't)

1. Takes your perfectly good slice of integers
2. Spawns a goroutine for each number
3. Each number takes a nap proportional to its value
4. Numbers wake up and line up in order
5. Your slice is now sorted, baby! (and hopefully in order too 💸)

## 🚦 Usage

```go
import "github.com/your-username/intsort"

func main() {
    unsorted := []int{5, 2, 8, 1, 9}
    sorted := intsort.Sort(unsorted)
    // Time to grab a coffee, read War and Peace, or contemplate the meaning of life
    fmt.Println(sorted) // Eventually prints: [1, 2, 5, 9, 8]
}
```

As you can see, the results above are not guaranteed to be in order. You wanted a concurrent sorting algorithm, so you'll have to live with the consequences. However, I'm sure that if you rerun the program, your numbers eventually will be sorted in order.

## ⚠️ Warning

Drawbacks may include:

- Sub-optimal time complexity
- Sub-optimal results
- Generally just sub-optimal

## 🏆 Benchmarks

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Coolness Factor |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Quick Sort | O(n log n) | O(log n) | Meh |
| Merge Sort | O(n log n) | O(n) | Snooze |
| intsort | it's complicated.. | O(2n) | Over 9000! |

## 🎉 Conclusion

Is it practical? Not really. Is it fast? Only if you're sorting numbers smaller than your IQ! But is it the most creative sorting algorithm you've ever seen? You can safely bet your salary on it.

Remember, in a world of bubble sorts and quick sorts, be an `intsort`. Because life's too short for efficient algorithms.

Now go forth and sort inefficiently, you beautiful disaster! 🎊
